# Lovecraftian Library

A **JavaScript** library for my other mods, containing utility methods and all the content templates. The library does not add any new contents, but can serve as a QOL mod with its features like damage display, recipe searching, etc.

Lovec is based on my previous mod [Reindustrialization](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Reindustrialization), which has been archived and separated into several mods now. Also see [LovecLab](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Laboratory) and [ProjReind](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Project-Reindustrialization) where actual contents are created.

Mod forum on Discord: https://discord.com/channels/391020510269669376/1346118807734845440.

Library features:

- JS-based class structure and methods.

- Extensible content templates for adding contents.

## For JS modders

Lovec is not a good start for modders to learn modding in JavaScript, since there are major changes in modding structure and common methods. If you are still new to JavaScript, I personally recommend starting from [Sapphirium](https://github.com/3Snake3/Sapphirium) or [AdvanceContent](https://github.com/EyeOfDarkness/AdvanceContent).

A lot of methods in Lovec are defined globally (and used everywhere). See [globalScript.js](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Library-Java/blob/master/assets/scripts/globalScript.js) and [jsExt](https://github.com/HuanXefh/Lovecraftian-Library-Java/tree/master/assets/scripts/run/jsExt) for more info.
