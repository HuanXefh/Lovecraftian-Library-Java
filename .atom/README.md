Files here are meant for Atom, a code editor I use a lot which has been archived.

How to import files in this folder:

1. Find your Atom data folder, usually under "C:/Users/*user name*/.atom".

2. Copy everything here.

3. Paste them under ".atom/packages/lovec-utils", or any folder with a different name you like.
