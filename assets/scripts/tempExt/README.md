Unlike regular templates, any template defined inside "lovec/scripts/tempExt" are made for other mods (with most Lovec mechanics stripped off to fit in vanilla gameplay).

See **LovecLab** or **ProjReind** for examples on how to create contents with content templates!

If you'd like to see some external version of existing Lovec templates, feel free to submit an issue on GitHub.
